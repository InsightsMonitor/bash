# Roadmap

In the near term, with no particular order

- Get parser to a stable state
- Add tests coverage

Maybe

- Use surge.sh instead of GitHub Pages for hosting the docs
  - This would allow to host: Flow Coverage, Tests Coverage, ...
- Include Sonar support (to run via Docker)
- RULE: Require `set -e` in script
